<h1> Welcome to my Static Web Page</h1>


<h2> This has been a very challenging eight weeks to say the least. I started this coarse with absolutely no web developement background at all. I have tried to get a positive outlook during the whole process. Somedays have proved more challenging than others!! I look forward to continue growth and knowledge while in this course.</h2>
